# DOODLE!

This is my little playground for creating web based canvas doodles.  The usual dev setup uses browser sync so doodles reload automatically for quick debugging, as well as a nice schema definition that populates a property grid for interactive editing and debugging!  I will update this more in the future to explain how you can make your own doodles!
